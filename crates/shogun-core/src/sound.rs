//! Sound cues — and, first, the rules for staying silent (Issue #49, `docs/sound-design.md`).
//!
//! SHOGUN reads the microphone and system audio. Anything it *plays* through the built-in
//! speaker is picked up again by the built-in microphone, which means a UI chime can
//!
//! 1. land in the user's own transcript as `Speaker::Me` and propagate into the recap, and
//! 2. be heard by everyone else on the call, with no way for them to tell where it came from.
//!
//! The system tap already excludes our own process (`audio::capture::system_tap`), so that third
//! path is closed. The two above cannot be closed by an API — only by not playing. That is why
//! this module is a *silence* policy with a sound attached, and why the decision lives here as a
//! pure function instead of at each call site.
//!
//! The four rules (design doc §3):
//!
//! - **S1 Hot-mic silence** — any process holding an input device, on built-in speakers: nothing
//!   plays, `Fail` included.
//! - **S2 Unattended silence** — cues that are not `Ask`/`Fail` need the user to have asked for
//!   them (`Pref::Full`).
//! - **S3 L1 silence** — automatic execution never makes a sound. Enforced structurally: there is
//!   no [`Cue`] for an L1 outcome, so a call site cannot ask for one.
//! - **S4 Quiet hours** — inside the user's quiet window everything is silent, `Ask`/`Fail`
//!   included. The Dream Cycle runs at night; a sleeping Mac stays quiet.
//!
//! The shell (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/sound.rs`) senses [`Env`] and performs the playback;
//! every "should this make a noise" question is answered here, where it can be tested without a
//! Mac.

/// What a cue is *for*. Drives the default policy, not the file that gets played.
